## Initial report of fastq read quality

```{r fastqc_overview}
summary(fastqc_tibble)
```

Overall looking great, but all samples fail at k-mer content, per-base sequence content and duplication levels. All of those are expected in RNAseq.
48 samples have overrepresented sequence warnings (normal for RNAseq) and 23 have warnings on per-sequence GC content.

## Explore per-sequence GC content bias

```{r GC bias_1}
# Select problematic sample, read its zip file and plot
failed_samples = 
  fastqc_tibble %>%
  filter(., module == "Sequence Duplication Levels" & status == "FAIL") %>%
  pull(., 'sample') %>%
  str_replace(string = ., pattern = "fq.gz", replacement = "") %>%
  paste0(fastqc_dir, .) %>% magrittr::extract(10) %>%
  print(.) %T>%
  qc_read(., verbose = T) 

qc_plot(qc = failed_samples, modules = "Sequence Duplication Levels")
```
